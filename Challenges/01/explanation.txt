Challenge 1: Fix Twitter!

Problem

Twitter has been bought and they want to remove the bots. They have asked you for help in detecting the number of users in their database who have corrupted data.

The database is very old and in a strange format. Profiles require the following data:

usr: username
do: email
psw: password
age: age
loc: location
fll: number of followers
It's all in one file where the user data is a sequence of `key:value` pairs, which can be on the same line or separated by lines, and each user is separated by a newline. Be careful because everything can be messy!

input example:

usr:@midudev eme:mi@gmail.com psw:123456 age:22 loc:bcn fll:82

fll:111 eme:yrfa@gmail.com usr:@codember psw:123456 age:21 loc:World

psw:11133 loc:Canary fll:333 usr:@pheralb eme:pheralb@gmail.com

usr:@itziar age:19 loc:isle psw:aaa fll:222 eme:itzi@gmail.com

The first user IS valid. It has all the fields.
The second user IS valid. It has all the fields.
The third user is NOT valid. You are missing the `age` field.
The fourth user YES is valid. It has all the fields. .

Now that you know this, use this input to catch the wrong users: https://codember.dev/users.txt

Tracks
The data can be in any order.
The data can be on the same line or separated by lines.
Users are separated by a blank line break.
Users may be repeated, but it doesn't matter, they are still valid.
Data may come that is not necessary for the user but that does not make it invalid.
