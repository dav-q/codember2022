Challenge 5: Frameworks and Libraries Battle Royale

Problem

There is so much framework and library that we don't know what to use anymore. So a committee has decided to do a kind of The Hunger Games to decide which technology stays.

He has placed all the technologies in a circle randomly. The tech at index 0 starts by killing the one to its immediate right (index + 1).

The next turn is for the tech that is alive to the right of the one that just died. And so on until there is only one left. Take a look at this example of a group of 10 technologies, step by step:

           5
      6     4
   7           3
   8           2
      9     1
         0

0 kills 1 
2 kills 3 
4 kills 5 
6 kills 7 
8 kills 9 
         X
     6      4
   X           X
   8           2
      X     X
         0
0 kills 2 
4 kills 6 
8 kills 0 
          X
     X      4
   X           X
   8           X
      X     X
         X
4 kills 8 
         X
     X      4
   X           X
   X           X
      X     X
         X
The technology in index 4 is the one that has survived.

Now, to prove that we are capable of creating a working algorithm, we have the list of patrons of the midudev community: https://codember.dev/patrons.json 

You have to create an algorithm that tells us which user would survive using the same system.

How to submit the solution
Submit the solution with the submit command, and the index of the surviving person and their username, separated by a hyphen.
