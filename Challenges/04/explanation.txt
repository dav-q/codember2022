Challenge 4: Find your friend's password

Problem

A friend bought 5 BitCoins in 2008. The problem is that he had it in a digital wallet... and he can't remember the password!

He has asked us for help. And she has given us some clues:

- It's a 5-digit password. - The password had the number 5 repeated at least twice. - The number on the right is always greater than or equal to the one on the left.

He has given us some examples: 55678 is correct, it does everything 12555 is correct, it does everything 55555 is correct, it does everything 12345 is incorrect, it does not have a repeated 5. 57775 is incorrect, the numbers are not increasing

It says that the password is between the numbers 11098 and 98123. Can we tell you how many numbers meet those rules within that range?
