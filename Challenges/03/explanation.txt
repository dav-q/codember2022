Challenge 3: The colored zebra

Problem

TMChein is already preparing for the holidays and wants to start decorating the house with Christmas lights.

He wants to buy one but his favorites are the ones with two colors that alternate. Like a two-color zebra.

You have made the lights to be Arrays and each position a color. And he wants to know which lights the longest zebras have and which is the last color in that succession of colors. For example:

['red', 'blue', 'red', 'blue', 'green'] -> 4, blue
['green', 'red', 'blue', 'gray'] -> 2, gray
['blue', 'blue', 'blue', 'blue'] -> 1, blue
['red', 'green', 'red', 'green', 'red', 'green'] -> 6, green
['blue', 'red', 'blue', 'red', 'gray'] -> 4, red
['red', 'red', 'blue', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'green'] -> 3, red
['red', 'blue', 'red', 'green', 'red', 'green', 'red', 'green'] -> 6, green
Notice that he only wants to know the length of when two colors alternate. Once the alternation of the two colors is broken, it stops counting.

Now that you know this, https://codember.dev/colors.txt

Remember that a colored zebra is when two colors alternate over and over again. If a color is repeated in the next position or it is a third color, then it stops counting.
What we want to calculate is the longest strip of colors in the shape of a zebra and the last color of that strip of colors.
